## About Me

Self-taught programmer with a **B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering** (CCS University, Meerut) and **3+ years of experience** designing and scaling high-performance backend systems. Currently working as a **Backend & AI Engineer at EI Networks**, where I architect distributed systems that serve **millions of users and IoT devices** in production.

I care deeply about writing clean, performant code and building infrastructure that doesn't break at 3 AM.

## What I Bring to the Table

| Domain | What I've Done |
|---|---|
| **Backend Engineering** | Designed and scaled APIs serving **10M+ users** across attendance, analytics, and recognition platforms |
| **Real-Time Systems** | Built WebSocket servers handling **20K+ concurrent connections** with sub-second latency |
| **System Design** | Architected distributed systems with sharding, caching (Redis), race-condition handling, and horizontal scaling |
| **AI & Computer Vision** | Engineered backend pipelines for ANPR and face recognition processing **2M+ enrolled images** |
| **DevOps** | Containerized deployments with Docker & Kubernetes on AWS, with fully automated CI/CD pipelines |
| **Web3** | Built Elixia, an award-winning blockchain platform for document authenticity verification |
