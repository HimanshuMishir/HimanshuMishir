## About Me

Self-taught programmer with a **B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering** (CCS University, Meerut) and **3+ years of experience** designing and scaling high-performance backend systems.

Currently at **[Rival.io](https://rival.io)** (since Sep 2025), where I build the **core execution engine** behind **[CortexOne](https://cortexone.rival.io)** — a peer-to-peer distributed Function-as-a-Service platform and AI function marketplace. Think of it as the open alternative to AWS Lambda: multi-runtime (Python, JS, Lua, WASM), gRPC-based with sub-millisecond latency, zero-trust security, and serverless MCP server hosting.

Previously at **EI Networks**, where I architected distributed systems serving **millions of users and IoT devices** in production.

I care deeply about writing clean, performant code and building infrastructure that doesn't break at 3 AM.

## What I Bring to the Table

| Domain | What I've Done |
|---|---|
| **Runtime & Execution Engines** | Building CortexOne's multi-runtime (Python, JS, Lua, WASM) gRPC-based execution engine with sub-ms latency |
| **Distributed Systems** | Peer-to-peer FaaS architecture, device-level sharding, horizontal scaling, and race-condition handling |
| **Backend Engineering** | Designed and scaled APIs serving **10M+ users** across attendance, analytics, and recognition platforms |
| **Real-Time Systems** | Built WebSocket servers handling **20K+ concurrent connections** with sub-second latency |
| **AI & Computer Vision** | Engineered backend pipelines for ANPR and face recognition processing **2M+ enrolled images** |
| **DevOps** | Containerized deployments with Docker & Kubernetes on AWS, with fully automated CI/CD pipelines |
| **Web3** | Built Elixia, an award-winning blockchain platform for document authenticity verification |

## Experience

### Rival.io — Software Engineer `Sep 2025 – Present`
> Building the core execution engine behind [CortexOne](https://cortexone.rival.io)

- Developing the **multi-runtime execution engine** powering CortexOne — a distributed FaaS platform and AI function marketplace
- Engine supports **Python, JavaScript, Lua, and WASM** runtimes with **gRPC-based orchestration** delivering sub-millisecond latency
- Building serverless **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server hosting** infrastructure
- Working on **zero-trust security architecture** with isolated ephemeral execution environments, identity-bound credentials, and end-to-end encrypted execution paths
- Platform serves as the open alternative to AWS Lambda — no vendor lock-in, self-hostable, peer-to-peer distributed compute

### EI Networks Pvt. Ltd. — Backend & AI Engineer `Previously`
> Architected distributed systems serving millions of users and IoT devices

- Scaled **Attendance Middleware (AMS)** to **10M+ employees** across **1M+ biometric devices**, sustaining **3–4 req/sec/device** with Redis caching and device-level sharding
- Built **SmartListener**, a WebSocket server handling **20K+ concurrent users** for IVR services using `uWebSockets.js` + Redis pub/sub
- Engineered backend for **ANPR & Face Recognition** systems processing **2M+ enrolled images** with high-throughput video analytics pipelines
- Designed **Sales Analytics Platform** with real-time data pipelines and sub-second aggregation dashboards
